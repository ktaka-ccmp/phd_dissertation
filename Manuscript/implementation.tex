Figure~\ref{fig:poc} shows the schematic diagram of proof of concept container cluster system with the proposed software load balancers.
%
Each load balancer pod consists of an exabgp\cite{exa-networks_2018} container and an ipvs container.
The ipvs container is responsible for distributing the traffic toward the service IP to web server(nginx) pods.
The IP address for nginx pods and load balancer pods are dynamically assigned upon launch of themselves from 172.16.0.0/16 address range.
The ipvs container monitors the availability of web server pods by consulting apiserver on the master node and manages the load balancing rule appropriately.
The exabgp container is responsible for advertising the route toward the service IP to the route reflector using BGP.
The route reflector aggregates the routing information advertised by load balancer pods and advertise them to the upstream router.
The upstream router updates its routing table according to the advertisement.

All the nodes and route reflector are configured using Debian 9.5 with self compiled linux-4.16.12 kernel.  
The author also used conventional Linux system as an upstream router for testing purpose, using the same OS as the nodes and route reflector.
The version of Linux kernel needed to be 4.12 or later to support hash based ECMP routing table.
The author also needed to enable kernel config option CONFIG\_IP\_ROUTE\_MULTIPATH\cite{ipsysctl} when compiling, and set the kernel parameter fib\_multipath\_hash\_policy=1 at run time.
Although in the actual production environment, proprietary hardware router with the highest throughput is usually deployed, one can still test some of the advanced features by using a conventional Linux system as the router.

    \label{table:bgp_agents}
  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{table:bgp_agents} compares open source BGP agents in terms of required features for the proposed architecture.
Each load balancer {\em pod} needs to advertise a static route for the service IP to itself. 
For that purpose, exabgp is preferable because it only requires to add a line, e.g., \enquote{route Service\_IP next-hop Pod\_IP} in the configuration file.
The gobgpd and the bird require other client programs to inject the static route after the daemon itself is up and running.
For example, in the case of gobgpd, after launching gobgpd, a user is required to issue a command line, e.g., \enquote{gobgp global rib add Service\_IP/32 origin igp nexthop Pod\_IP community 100:50 -a ipv4}.
(The gobgp is a client program to manage gobgpd.)
This is a bit complex and error-prone, especially when one needs to make sure the route injection is done inside a container.

As for the route reflector, add-path\cite{rfc7911} feature is needed for multi-path advertisement, which is supported by gobgpd.
For the upstream router Forwarding Information Base(FIB) manipulation\cite{exa-networks_2018} feature is needed, which is supported by gobgpd through zebra\cite{osrg_gobgp_zebra}.
As a result, exabgp is used for the load balancer pods, gobgpd is used for the route reflector, and gobgpd and zebra are used for the upstream router.

The other features needed for the route reflector are a dynamic-neighbor feature to describe peer group as a range of IP address, and overlay network feature on the Linux system.
The configurations for the upstream router is summarised in Appendix~\ref{appendix:router_config}.
The configurations for the route reflector is summarised in Appendix~\ref{appendix:route_reflector_config}.

\subsection{Ipvs container}\label{sec:ipvs}

In order to demonstrate a software load balancer that is runnable in any environment, the author created Docker container using ipvs.
In addition to that, the proposed load balancer uses two other components, keepalived, and a controller.
These components are placed in a single Docker container image.
The ipvs is a Layer-4 load balancer capability, which is included in the Linux kernel 2.6.0 released in 2003 or later,
to distribute incoming Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) traffic to
{\em real servers}\footnote{The term, {\em real servers} refers to worker servers that will respond to incoming traffic,
in the original literature\cite{Zhang2000}. The author will also use this term in a similar way.}\cite{Zhang2000}.
For example, ipvs distributes incoming Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) traffic destined for a single destination IP address,
to multiple HTTP servers(e.g. Apache HTTP or nginx) running on multiple nodes in order to improve the performance of web services.
Keepalived is a management program that performs health checking for {\em real servers}
and manages ipvs balancing rules in the kernel accordingly.
It is often used together with ipvs to facilitate ease of use.
The controller is a daemon that periodically monitors the {\em pod} information on the master,
and it performs various actions when such information changes.
Kubernetes provides ingress controller framework as the Go Language(Golang) package to implement the controllers.
The author implemented a controller program that feeds {\em pod} state changes to keepalived
using this framework.

The proposed load balancer needs to dynamically reconfigure the ipvs balancing rules whenever {\em pods} are created or deleted. 
Figure~\ref{fig:ipvs-ingress-schem} is a schematic diagram of ipvs container to show the dynamic reconfiguration of the ipvs rules.
Two daemon programs, controller and keepalived, running in the container are illustrated.
The keepalived manages Linux kernel's ipvs rules depending on the ipvs.conf configuration file.
It can also periodically check the liveness of a {\em real server}
%
%\footnote{The term, {\em real servers} refers to worker servers that will respond to incoming traffic, 
%in the original literature\cite{Zhang2000}. We will also use this term in the similar way.}, 
which is represented as a combination of the IP addresses and port numbers of the target {\em pods}. 
If the health check to a {\em real server} fails, keepalived will remove that {\em real server} from the ipvs rules immediately.
The interval of the health check is typically 1 to several seconds and is arbitrarily determined by users.  

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Figs/ipvs-ingress-schem}
  
    \par\bigskip
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.9\columnwidth}
      \caption[Implementation of ipvs container]{
        Implementation of ipvs container.
        The controller checks the pod status every second, by consulting the master node.
        Upon a change of the status, the controller updates the ipvs.conf and sends SIGHUP to keepalived.
        The keepalived reload the ipvs.conf and updates the load balancing rules in the kernel correctly.
      }
      \label{fig:ipvs-ingress-schem}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Every second, the controller monitors information concerning the running {\em pods} of a web application in the Kubernetes cluster by consulting the apiserver running in the master through its API.
Whenever {\em pods} are created or deleted, the controller notices the change and automatically regenerate an appropriate ipvs.conf 
and issue SIGHUP to keepalived within a second.
Then, keepalived will reload the ipvs.conf, and modify the kernel's ipvs rules correctly depending on the result of the health check.

When a pod is terminated, existing connections are reset by the node kernel.
The SYN packets sent to a pod after termination, but before the ipvs rule update, will be answered with ICMP unreachable by the node.
In these cases, the client sees connection errors.
In order to avoid the connection errors to be seen by a human, HTTP client programs are required to re-initiate the connection.
However, since the load balancer rule update is within a second, these errors can be regarded as the tolerable rare exceptions even without such re-initiations.

The actual controller\cite{ktaka_ccmp_2017_826894} is implemented using the Kubernetes ingress controller\cite{K8sIngress2017} framework. 
By importing existing Golang package, \enquote{k8s.io/ingress/core/pkg/ingress}, the author could simplify the implementation, e.g. 
120 lines of code(Appendix~\ref{appendix:ingress_controller}).
%
Keepalived and the controller are placed in the docker image of ipvs container.
The ipvs is the kernel function and namespace separation for container has already been supported in the recent Linux kernel. 

Configurations for capabilities were needed when deploying the ipvs container: adding the CAP\_SYS\_MODULE capability 
to the container to allow the kernel to load required kernel modules inside a container, 
and adding CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to the container to allow keepalived to manipulate the kernel's ipvs rules. 
For the former case, the author also needed to mount the \enquote{/lib/module} of the node's file system on the container's file system.

In order to implement the ECMP redundancy, the author also containerized exabgp using Docker.
Figure~\ref{fig:exabgp_schem} shows a schematic diagram of the network path realized by the exabgp container.
As mentioned earlier, the author used exabgp as the BGP advertiser. 
The ingress traffic from the Internet is forwarded by ECMP routing table on the router to the node that hosts a load balancer pod.
And then it is routed to the load balancer pod according to the set of routing rules in Table~\ref{table:exabgp_setting}(2),(3).
After that the ipvs forwards them to nginx pods.
The IP address of any pod is dynamically assigned from 172.16.0.0/16 when the pod is started. 

Table~\ref{table:exabgp_setting} summarises some key settings required in the exabgp container to route the traffic to the ipvs container.
(1) In BGP announcements the node IP address, 10.0.0.106 is used as the next-hop for the service IPs, 10.1.1.0/24.
(2) Then on the node, in order to route the packets toward the service IPs to the ipvs container, 
a routing rule for 10.1.1.0/24 to the dev docker0 is created in the node net namespace. 
(3) A routing rule to accept the packets toward the service IPs as local is also required in the container net namespace. 
The configuration for exabgp is shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:exabgp_config}.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, the author provided a discussion of load balancer architecture and its implementations suitable for container clusters.
%
First, the author discussed the problems of conventional architecture.
Since Kubernetes is dependent on external load balancers provided by the cloud infrastructures,
it failed to provide portability of a web application in environments where there was no supported load balancer.
Furthermore, the routes that ingress traffic from the internet follow were very complex and inefficient.

In order to alleviate these problems, the author proposed a cluster of software load balancers in containers.
The proposed load balancers utilized container technology and were managed by Kubernetes.
As a result, it is runnable on any environment including cloud infrastructures and on-premise data centers.
Furthermore, since Kubernetes manages load balancer containers, it can quickly scale the number of containers depending on the demand.
%
The author also discussed redundant architecture using ECMP with BGP for proposed load balancer containers.
By using the ECMP, the upstream router can route the ingress traffic to a cluster of load balancer containers in a redundant and scalable manner.
By using BGP, ECMP routing rules in the upstream router are automatically populated, upon the launch of load balancer containers.
The BGP and ECMP are both standard protocols supported by most of the commercial router products.

Thanks to the proposed load balancer, users become being able to set up routes to their web applications automatically, upon its launch, regardless of the infrastructures they use.  
This will greatly improve the portability of a web application and thereby enables migrations.
