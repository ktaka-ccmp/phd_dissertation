abstract = {Google's Borg system is a cluster manager that runs hun-dreds of thousands of jobs, from many thousands of differ-ent applications, across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines. It achieves high utilization by combining admission con-trol, efficient task-packing, over-commitment, and machine sharing with process-level performance isolation. It supports high-availability applications with runtime features that min-imize fault-recovery time, and scheduling policies that re-duce the probability of correlated failures. Borg simplifies life for its users by offering a declarative job specification language, name service integration, real-time job monitor-ing, and tools to analyze and simulate system behavior. We present a summary of the Borg system architecture and features, important design decisions, a quantitative anal-ysis of some of its policy decisions, and a qualitative ex-amination of lessons learned from a decade of operational experience with it.},

@article{Zhang2000,
abstract = {This paper describes the motivation, design, internal implementation of Linux Virtual Server. The goal of Linux Virtual Server is to provide a basic framework to build highly scalable and highly available network services using a large cluster of commodity servers. The TCP/IP stack of Linux kernel is extended to support three IP load balancing techniques, which can make parallel services of different kinds of server clusters to appear as a service on a single IP address. Scalability is achieved by transparently adding or removing a node in the cluster, and high availability is provided by detecting node or daemon failures and reconfiguring the system appropriately.},

abstract = {Containers are becoming a popular way of deploying applications quickly, cheaply, and reliably. As with the early days of virtual machines, a variety of container networking configurations have been proposed to deal with the issues of discovery, flexibility and performance. Using Docker we present available networking configurations along with many of the popular networking setups, their uses, and their problems today. A second aspect we will explore are containers in clusters, as these systems rely even more heavily on the network. We use Kubernetes as an example of this type of system. We present the network setups of the core components of Kubernetes: pods and services.},
